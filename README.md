`LSTM.ipynb` trains an LSTM model on stock time series data using Keras and saves it as `STOCK.keras`. `lstm_real.py` is a Streamlit app that loads the model, fetches historical OHLCV data, processes it, and visualizes technical indicators and predicted prices. `STOCK.keras` stores the trained model for inference.
